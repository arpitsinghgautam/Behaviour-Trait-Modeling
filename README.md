# Behaviour-Trait-Modeling 🧠

## Introduction 🚀
This project aims to develop a depression detection system using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Depression is a prevalent mental health condition, and early detection is crucial for timely intervention and support. By analyzing text data, we can potentially identify individuals at risk of depression or those who might benefit from mental health resources. 👩‍⚕️

## Features ✅
- Multi-Task Learning: The project explores the use of multi-task learning to simultaneously predict depression severity and PTSD risk. 📊
- Transfer Learning: Leveraging pre-trained models for text analysis to capture nuanced language patterns. 📖
- Early Stopping: Investigates the impact of early stopping on model training and validation performance. ⏱️
- Multimodal Data: Optionally, this project can be extended to include multimodal data, such as audio, video, or physiological signals, to enhance depression detection. 📈

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- Python: The primary programming language for data preprocessing, model development, and analysis. 🐍
- PyTorch: A popular deep learning framework used for building and training neural network models. 🧠
- Jupyter Notebook: A popular tool for interactive data analysis and model prototyping. 📓
- Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn): For creating informative data visualizations. 📊
- Data Preprocessing Tools (e.g., Pandas, scikit-learn): For data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering. 🧹

## Uses 🌟
- Mental Health Screening: The project can be applied to screen individuals for potential depressive symptoms based on their text responses. 🩺
- Early Intervention: Identifying individuals at risk of depression or PTSD for early intervention and support. 🤝
- Research and Insights: The insights gained from this project can be valuable for mental health research and understanding how language correlates with mental health conditions. 📚
- Customization: The code can be customized and extended to include additional features, data sources, or other mental health conditions for detection. 🛠️
